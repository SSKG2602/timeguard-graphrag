# Timeguard GraphRAG

This repository provides core components for building a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system focused on time-oriented data.

## Features

- Graph storage helpers (`graph_store.py`) for constructing and retrieving structured knowledge.
- Server and command-line entry points (`server.py`, `run.py`, `tg_graphrag.py`) to interact with the RAG engine.
- Configuration via `render.yaml` and Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the service locally with:

```bash
python run.py
```

This README intentionally focuses on current functionality and avoids speculative expansion plans.
